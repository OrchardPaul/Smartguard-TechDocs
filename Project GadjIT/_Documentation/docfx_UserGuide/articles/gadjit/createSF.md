# Smartflow Organisation
## Live and Dev Systems
To promote best practice for development and rollout, GadjIT facilitiates a Live and Dev environment. Development can take place in either `System` but it is always advised to develop and test within **Dev** before rolling out to **Live**.

> [!NOTE]
> Copying Smartflows from **Dev** to **Live** can be acheived with just a couple of clicks, so it only takes a few seconds to rollout new changes.

## Case Types
Each `System` is organised into **Case Type Groups** followed by **Case Types** and finally Smartflows. This allows you to group Smartflows into a particular **Case Type** such as `RTA` and `Accident at Work` and save each under the **Case Type Group** of `Personal Injury`, as seen in the diagram below.

## Smartflows
Smartflows can be ordered to suit you. It is advised to order them in accordance with the general flow of a case starting with the initial steps and working towards case closure.

> [!NOTE]
> Smartflow order can be achieved by clicking the arrows on each Smartflow or by dragging with the mouse to the desired position.

# Creating a New Smartflow
Adding a new Smartflow is done from the main Smartflow listing screen (see [*Figure 1*](#case-types) above).

1. Click on the `New` button at the top of the page.

2. Set the options for what to call the Smartflow and where to position it within the Case Types.

**Figure 3** - Create `New` Smartflow options 

> [!NOTE]
> To place the Smartflow in a new **Case Type** simply place a tick in the `New` check box and type in a new Case Type name, the Smartflow will be created along with the new **Case Type**. The same applies to **Case Type Groups**

3. Position the Smartflow
Once created, the Smartflow will be initially positioned at the bottom of the **Case Type**. To reposition, simply drag the Smartflow to the desired place in the list or by clicking on the up and down arrows above and below the position index.  


# Configure a Smartflow
To complete the setup of a Smartflow you first have to enter the Smartflow for editing. Either click on the *pencil* icon or select `Edit` from the elipse menu (left hand side of the Smartflow item).

## Completing Setup
Setup requires a few items to be set on the left hand side of the screen to attach it to your **Case Management System** and a couple of optional display settings to the right of the screen.

### Assign to CMS and Create Step
1. **Case Type Group**  
Select the appropriate document storage area on your **Case Management System** you wish the Smartflow to belong. This should be the same for all the Smartflows within the current **Case Type**.

    **Figure 5** - Assign Smartflow to **Case Management System**

> [!NOTE]
> The dropdown list will contain all available matter level document storage locations *(Case Type Groups)* including `Global Documents` from your own system.

2. Select Smartflow
This will be almost always the matter level Smartflow. Simply select the option `ORSF MT Smartflow`.

3. Create the new Step
The final stage to creating a Smartflow on your **Case Management System** is to create a new step within the **Document Storage** area assigned above in *step 1*.

    Simply select the option `--- Create New ---` from the dropdown list. This will auto populate the text box with a relevant name, but this can be altered if required.

    **Figure 6** - Create new step in **Case Management System**

    Finally, click on the `Create` button to complete the process. A new step will automatically appear in your **Case Management System** and will be ready to run.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you have mulptiple **Case Types** within the **Case Type Group** it is advised to prefix the Smartflows to make steps with a similar purpose unique.  
  > 
  > For example, each **Case Type** may have a step for sending the Client Care Pack. But only one item named `SF Sending Client Care Pack Smartflow` can exist so add a few letters after the '*SF*' to indicate which **Case Type**. This is a restriction of your **Case Management System** and not Smartflow but it is good practice regardless.

### Complete Display Options
Finally, there are a few seetings which control the display and type of Smartflow.

1. Click on either the background colour or image to navigate to the `Background` tab.

> [!TIP]
  > To add more images to the list, click on the `Browse` button to upload a new set of images.  

  > [!TIP]
  > Ideally, images should be small in size as they are accessed over the internet. Set to a max width of 2000 pixels and save as type JPEG to reduce the size of very large images.
