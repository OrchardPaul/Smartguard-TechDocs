# What is Smartflow?
Smartflow is a new and unique way of working within process driven applications such as Case Management Systems. Designed initially for the legal sector where workflows are essential for providing users an efficient means of accessing and scheduling tasks. This new way of working reduces the time it takes for a user to select the relevant actions whilst providing more flexibility if required.

## Single Interface
Unlike traditional workflows, Smartflow has a single interface regardless of worktype. Only the contents of the screen changes depending upon the stage the case is at. Instead of the workflow asking a user several questions and then predecting the next stage or batch of letters to produce, Smartflow instead lists only relevant options for the current stage, allowing the user to select which tasks to complete or schedule next.  

Users are presented with all relevant case details to enable accurate decision making, including:  
- User Notes  
- Case History  
- Key data saved to the case  
- Current status information  
- Matter ledger details  

## Streamline
The main purpose of Smartflow is to provide an environment that is always familiar to the user allowing them to analyse and process data to rapidly move the case forward. 

## Flexibility
Smartflow allows users to customise workflows as they progress through a case should the need require. Tasks can be altered to display alternative names in the history, schedule details can be amended and/or assigned to other users.
