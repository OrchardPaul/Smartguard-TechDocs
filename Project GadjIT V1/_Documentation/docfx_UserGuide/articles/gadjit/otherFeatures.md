## Ticker Messages
Ticker messages are a great way of notifying users of key changes such as changes to legistlation applicable to the **Smartflow** they are currently running or just a change to the **Smartflow** itself, for example a new document has been added. The message runs from right to left across the top of the **Smartflow** screen. Ticker messages can be scheduled to start and end on specific dates and you can have up to 3 ticker messages running or scheduled at any one time.
